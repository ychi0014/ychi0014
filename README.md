### Hello Github ðŸ‘‹

I am making an about me page in hopes that I would finally get approved for the Github Student Developer Pack (https://education.github.com/pack)
after numerous attempts on making requests for it since 2019.

I am a student currently enrolled in Monash University Malaysia that is currently pursuing a Bachelors in Software Engineering and I am requesting
access to the Github Student Developer Pack for school projects relating to units such as: FIT4002 (https://handbook.monash.edu/2023/units/FIT4002?year=2023)
